        Welcome to the balloon game!
        \n\nIn this game you are asked to pump up 30 balloons.
        \n\nTo pump up a balloon tap the “PUMP“ button. Try it!
    </string>
    <string name="game_info1">
        For each pump you get points.
        \n\nBut remember balloons pop if you pump them up too much!
        \n\nIf a balloon pops, you will not collect points. You have to wait for the next balloon and try again.
    </string>
    <string name="txt_info1">
        Some of these balloons might pop after one pump, others might not pop until they fill the entire screen.
        \n\nIt is up to you to decide how much to pump each balloon. How many pumps does it take to pop this balloon? Try it!
    </string>
    <string name="txt_info2">
        You can stop pumping at any time by tapping the “COLLECT POINTS” button.
        Try it!
    </string>
    <string name="txt_info3">
       The more points you collect the higher the prize will be.
        \n\nThere are four prizes: a small prize, a medium prize, a big prize, and a bonus prize.
        The meter will show you how close you are to each.
